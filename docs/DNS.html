    As mentioned before DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is one of the most important tools on the internet. It connects your PC to the IP address of the destination you are seeking. DNS is essentially a GPS that navigates IP addresses, instead of coordinates. In a GPS when seeking for a destination you search for the address, the GPS will then proceed to take you there. On the contrary, DNS will take into account what you're searching for and use other DNS to find the IP address of what you are searching for. When DNS gets a hold of the address, it gets stored for a later time and directs your PC to the IP address. Since DNS has to be able to connect you to a lot of websites. DNS servers are distributed into different groups. These groups cover the most common domains. Domains such as .com, .net, .org, etc all have a DNS server. These servers then share the IP addresses to other servers when requested. DNS can be compromised by hackers. This is called DNS Spoofing, during a DNS spoofing hackers tend to get control over a DNS and redirect the IP addresses to fake websites causing problems.
